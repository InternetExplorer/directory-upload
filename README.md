# Directory Upload Proposal

This proposal is not currently maintained and has been archived.  At the time
of archival, work to document and improve the 'webkitdirectory' behavior was
ongoing in the
[File and Directory Entries API](https://github.com/WICG/entries-api) proposal.

The directory upload proposal can be found here: 
https://wicg.github.io/directory-upload/proposal.html.

A demo of the API using a polyfill (works only in Chrome) can be found here: https://wicg.github.io/directory-upload/index.html.
